Dive into the queries and interactive dashboards to leverage data for smarter investments, optimized inventory, and a stronger market position.
# Background
In today's data-rich environment, the ability to derive actionable insights from sales operations is a key differentiator. The supplement market, known for its high volume of transactions, diverse product categories (e.g., vitamins, minerals, protein, herbal), and multiple sales platforms (Amazon, Walmart, iHerb), generates a wealth of transactional data. This project was undertaken to harness this raw sales data, transforming it into clear, quantifiable metrics that reveal performance across products, locations, and e-commerce channels, ultimately guiding efforts to boost revenue and enhance efficiency in our supplement sales initiatives.

### To understand sales, profit across categories and locations in the supplement dataset, i asked this,
1. Which product categories and specific products generated the highest total revenue over the 5-year period?
2. How has  monthly revenue changed over time? Are there specific months or quarters when certain supplements sell better?
3. What is the distribution of sales across the three locations (USA, UK, Canada)? Has this distribution changed over the years?
4.  Which e-commerce platform (Amazon, Walmart, iHerb) has performed best in terms of revenue and units sold?
5.  How do return rates vary across different product categories? Which products have the highest and lowest return rates?
6.  For each location, which product categories are most popular based on units sold?
7. What is the average revenue per product category over time? Have certain categories shown consistent growth?
8. Which combination of product, platform, and location yields the highest revenue?
9. If we calculate net revenue (after accounting for returns), how does the ranking of products or categories change compared to gross revenue?

*Table for revenue, units sold by platform*
##  Business Question
**How do return rates vary across different product categories? Which products have the highest and lowest return rates?**
To understand product performance and customer satisfaction, I calculated the return rate for each product by comparing
the number of units returned to units sold. This helps identify which products are more frequently returned and which ones maintain consistent buyer trust.
### üí° Key Insights
Highest return rates were seen in **Vitamin C**, **Electrolyte Powder**, and **Magnesium**.
Lowest return rates occurred in **Ashwagandha**, **Zinc**, and **Fish Oil**.
This analysis reveals product satisfaction trends and helps guide inventory and marketing decisions.
### Strategic Recommendations
### Benchmarking & Context
- *Exceptional Performance*: The  observed return rates (around 1%) are remarkably low, especially compared to the typical e-commerce average of 15-20%. This suggests strong customer satisfaction, accurate product descriptions, or effective quality control.
It's valuable to know if these low rates are consistent across all product categories.
### Understanding "Why" (Critical Next Step)
- *Reasons for Returns*: The most impactful insight will come from understanding why products are being returned. Without this data, solutions are speculative. Implement a system to collect categorized return reasons (e.g., damaged, wrong item, didn't meet expectations, change of mind).
For **Vitamin C**, **Electrolyte Powder**, and **Magnesium** (the highest return items), dive into specific customer feedback.
Are there common complaints about taste, **effectiveness**, **packaging**, **or perceived quality**?

### üîç Business Question 
**What is the average annual revenue generated by each supplement product category from 2020 to 2025?**
Understanding these averages allows us to identify the most consistent and significant revenue contributors over a multi-year period, guiding long-term strategic investments and resource allocation.
### üí° Insights from Average Revenue & Trends
Combining these average figures with our understanding of recent trends:
- *Strong Core Performers*: Categories like Performance, **Amino Acid** , **Omega**, **Fat Burner**, **Protein**, and **Vitamin** demonstrate consistently high average annual revenues. These are the established pillars of our revenue stream.
- *Note for Amino Acid & Omega*: While their averages are high, previous trend analysis indicates recent fluctuations (Amino Acid peaking in 2023 and declining, Omega showing general volatility). Their high average is largely driven by strong performance in earlier years.
- *Rising Star*: Hydration holds a respectable average, and its previous trend analysis showed consistent year-over-year growth. This suggests it's a rapidly expanding market segment that is increasing its overall contribution.
- *Areas for Re-evaluation*: Herbal and especially Sleep Aid exhibit the lowest average annual revenues. Sleep Aid's lower average is directly linked to its significant decline in 2024-2025 from a 2023 peak, indicating potential market shifts or competitive pressures.
### üöÄ Strategic Recommendations
- *Maximize & Diversify Strong Performers (Performance, Amino Acid, Omega, Fat Burner)*:
- *Action*: Continue strong support and marketing for these categories, but with an emphasis on understanding the drivers of volatility (for Performance and Omega) and addressing recent declines (for Amino Acid).
- *Tactics*: For volatile categories, monitor market trends closely, explore new formulations or use cases, and diversify sourcing if raw material price fluctuations are an issue. For Amino Acid, a deep dive into competitive landscape and consumer needs is crucial to stabilize or reverse the decline.

##  üîç Business Question 
**Product Return Analysis: Gross vs. Net Revenue Performance**
This analysis compares gross and net revenue rankings across our product categories to understand the impact of customer returns. We aimed to identify if return behavior disproportionately affects any specific category or alters their overall performance ranking.
### üí° Insight
Our investigation reveals a **consistent return pattern across all product categories**. Despite varying return volumes, every category maintained its relative ranking when comparing gross revenue to net revenue (after accounting for returns). This suggests a healthy and proportional relationship between sales and returns.

* **Rank Stability:** All product categories retained their original positions in the ranking, even after accounting for returns. This indicates that return behavior is relatively consistent and does not skew category performance.
* **Top Performers Remain Strong:** The **Vitamin and Mineral** categories continue to be our top performers in both gross and net revenue. While they experience the highest absolute number of returns in units, this is primarily due to their higher sales volume, not a result of poor product performance or disproportionately high return rates.
* **Proportional Return Patterns:** No single category stands out as underperforming due to an unusually high return rate. Return patterns are proportional across the board.
##  Strategic Recommendation
  **Prioritize High Net Revenue Categories:**
    * **Action:** Focus retention and marketing efforts on high net revenue categories like **Vitamin, Mineral, and Performance**.
    * **Reason:** These categories consistently deliver the most value even after returns. Leverage data to **personalize marketing** and consider enhanced **loyalty programs** for customers in these segments.
 **Refine Return Process and Policy (Consideration):**
    * **Action:** Review the current return process for efficiency and customer experience. Explore options like incentivizing **exchanges over refunds** or, for very low-value items, potentially allowing customers to keep the product to save on reverse logistics costs.
    * **Reason:** A transparent and easy return process builds customer confidence, but optimizing it can also reduce operational costs and retain more revenue.
